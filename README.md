# DoublyLinkedList

This Repository is all about how to Implement DoublyLinkedList as well as doing some basics problems.

Things to remember :-

Add all the .java files in same package because, All ".java" files are interlinked and dependent on each other.

NOTE :- Value Inseretion is getting done automatically using Java.util.Random().
So, Don't bother about automatic input.

DoublyLinkedList Implementation :- 1.Insert, 2.Print( Both of these operation can be done from Head to End named as "Front Side" & End to Head named as "Back Side")

Extra Features :- 1.Delete, 2.Update, 3.Length of Doubly Linked List, 4.Find Node( All of these operation can be done from Head to End named as "Front Side" & End to Head named as "Back Side")
